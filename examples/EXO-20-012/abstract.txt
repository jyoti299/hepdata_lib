A search for resonances in the γ+jet final state has been performed using proton- proton collision data collected at √s = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The total data analyzed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb−1. Mod- els of excited quarks, including heavy-flavor quarks, and quantum black holes are considered. The invariant mass spectrum of the γ+jet system is examined for the presence of resonances over the standard model continuum background. The data exhibit no statistically significant deviations from the expected standard model back- ground. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the resonance mass and other parameters are set. Excited (heavy-flavor) quarks are excluded up to a mass of 6.0 (2.2) TeV. Quantum black hole production is excluded for masses up to 7.5 (5.2) TeV in the Arkani-Hamed–Dimopoulos–Dvali (Randall–Sundrum) models.
